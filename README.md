# FortiGate-Network-Baseline-Generator-PowerShell-
I recently built a PowerShell automation script that creates a network baseline configuration for FortiGate firewalls. The tool automatically generates a clean, consistent starting configuration using just the location acronym and the first two octets of the IP address making it faster and easier to deploy FortiGate firewalls across multiple sites.
ðŸ’¡ Highlights:
Streamlines baseline configuration creation
Promotes network standardization and scalability
Designed with real-world IT operations in mind
This project reflects my ongoing passion for automating network tasks and building tools that make IT infrastructure more efficient.

Open the code in Notepad++ or another editor, and change the two file paths to work.
$TemplatePath = 'C:\Users\snaingsu\Documents\Network\Baseline\Baseline_FortiGate_Template.conf'
$OutputFolder = 'C:\Users\snaingsu\Documents\Network\New config'
