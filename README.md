# FortiGate-Network-Baseline-Generator-PowerShell-
I recently built a PowerShell automation script that creates a network baseline configuration for FortiGate firewalls. The tool automatically generates a clean, consistent starting configuration using just the location acronym and the first two octets of the IP address making it faster and easier to deploy FortiGate firewalls across multiple sites.
